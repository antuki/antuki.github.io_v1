      <description>A small message in the night to share my happy mood of having a new blog which does not seem so bad after all.
And which allows me to create posts in a very simple way from R.
Like that i’m showing you for example the very trendy viridis palette and what we call violin diagram (kind of boxplot but much more better).
library(ggplot2)library(viridis)## Warning: le package &amp;#39;viridis&amp;#39; a été compilé avec la version R 3.</description>

      <description>COGugaison : an R package for manipulating french spatial databases produced at different dates
The administrative divisions of France (communes – counties – regions, departments…) change over time. Every year, some french territories change their codes, or names, merge or divide.
The COGugaison R package is based on the french official geographic code (COG) produced each year by the french National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (Insee). It has the objective of manipulating spatial databases produced at different dates by providing the list of existing towns and their history since fifty years and useful functions for transforming databases into geographic codes of other years.</description>

      <description>hello !
My name is Kim, i&amp;rsquo;m a female statistician and I love doing R when I&amp;rsquo;m lonely at home.
The objective of this blog is to share with you my R discoveries when I have time (some periods are more effective than others) and talk about developers or reseachers works and there super cool packages that I find interesting. I also love open data so I may also indicate some cool data to manipulate.</description>
